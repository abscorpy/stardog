A 2D space shooter RPG similar to Star Control 2, Escape Velocity, or Star Wolves 3. Far from finished and interested in collaboration.

features (status):

-Huge universe with sandbox non-linear game flow. (currently working on construction tools)

-Completely modular ship design: add and remove parts to your ship to make it as big or small as you want. (implemented)

-Parts can be blown off enemies, collected and equipped, all during battle (working)

-Enemy ships spawn with Diablo-style random part generation (implemented 10-29-10, needs much more content)

-Realistic 2D physics (working)

-A Dozen alien races to explore (some content, no implementation)

-Scores of types of enemy ships, each with their own ship design, tactics, and type of parts. (currently 2 with random design variants)

-Take hyperspace tunnels between solar systems (under construction)

Stardog is written in Python with Pygame.
