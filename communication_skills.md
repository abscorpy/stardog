# Communication Skills #

Communication skills develop as the player interacts with each alien race.  The level of the communication skill plays the largest role in which missions are available for the player to complete.  Early levels have synergies between some races.  Levels usually follow the pattern: basic, advanced, proficient, then perceptive and/or charismatic.
