#summary Details of missions

==Intro Story==
In the last battle of the war between the Earth and an alien race of zombies, you are one of several pilots charged with Nova Bombs- bombs capable of causing a star to go nova.  The human invasion force is no match for the zombie home fleet, but manages to breach enough of a hole to allow you to launch your nova bomb.  The star is hit, and begins to explode- guaranteeing victory for earth and death for every ship in the system.  

Your ship takes a direct hit from a zombie vessel.  It takes out many of your systems, including your communications.  With your mission completed and no way to tell anyone, you pick the fastest vector out of the system and slam on the afterburners.  The nova shockwave catches up to your ship, knocks you out, and breaches your cockpit.  Zombie biocreep spreads over the crack, sealing it, and seeping inside-- and toward your body.

...adrift in space a hundred years later, new life regains consciousness.  With zombie infesting both your brain and your ship, it certainly isn't human anymore... but, with the zombie hive mind-- and its entire solar system-- destroyed, it isn't entirely alien, either.
