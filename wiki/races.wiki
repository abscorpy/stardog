=Races=
    Most of the names are place holders.
==The Alliance==
A group of different races striving for collaboration.  It’s only clear, agreed objective is to create enough understanding and standardized communication to prevent wars of miscommunication, but even this much is difficult when not every race agrees that accidental wars are bad.  Different races within the alliance disagree about what the alliances primary objectives/methods should be.  The three largest members are the Union, the Benefactors, and the Archivists.  The Union pushes for collaboration, cooperation, and sharing; the Archivists just want to share scientific data, the Benefactors use the alliances infrastructure to facilitate their trade monopolies, complain about the costs of membership, and push for a large shared military (largely so they could sell it weapons).  Smaller factions include the Uplifted and at least three somewhat more backward, independent systems.  The Alliance’s standardization efforts have found some adoption by the dramatics, Nanopirates, and the AI, making it easier to communicate with them.

*Main quest: spread the Alliance!  Persuade more races to join, help determine it’s temperament - if it is militaristic help it conquer others.
===Union===
The driving force behind the alliance.  From a system where two races developed independently, then developed a strong symbiosis after developing space travel, they believe very strongly in cooperation.  They are also the most afraid of nano-tech, and the most anti-pirate.  They dislike the AI because the AI generally refuse to integrate or even acknowledge that the alliance exists, but the realize that the AI meets all of the Alliance’s criteria for membership- this frustrates them.  Rationally it is clear that their efforts should be focused on more caustic races nearby.

*Main quest: destroy the Nanopirates. (Conflicts with Nanopirates)
===Archivists===
A slow, methodical species, whose greatest joy seems to be recording every possible detail about absolutely everything.  They are loathe to actually do anything with this knowledge, unless it promises to give them access to new things to study.  They are unsatisfied with the records kept by anyone else.  Individuals specialize extremely, and an archivist might spend his life cataloguing the topography and geography of a particular crater on a particular moon.  What drives each archivist to his or her specialty is mysterious, and the event of discovering one’s passion is one of the few subjects of art among archivists and one of the few things treated as sacred (aside from each archivist’s own field of study).

Somewhere, during an interaction with archivists, a junior crewman has the revelation that a (random) detail of the player is his interest, immediately decides to dedicate his life to studying you, and demands permission to do so.  If your ship has pressurized cargo, he will request to stay in it.  Otherwise his superiors will grant him a small craft to follow you around in.  Over time, his work will grant you specific experience points.

*Main quest: meet the young Archivist, take him on as a companion.
===Benefactors===
The race that uplifted The Uplifted.  Really just did it to win the war; they are colonialist bastards.  They should have lots of other features, and The Uplifted should be a mostly forgotten concern to them. Currently fighting a war wit the memoryless and the dramatics for a very desirable system.  Have economically exploitative relations with the Uplifted, the backward groups in the sector. Have less exploitative relations with the Archivists.  Have black market relations with the nanopirates.

*Main quest: help the benefactors win the war for c3. (Conflicts with Memoryless and Dramatics)
===The Uplifted===
A race that is fast to reproduce and to mature (inspired by Mass Effect’s Krogan and Star Control’s Shofixti).  They were fairly primitive until a couple hundred years ago, when they were “uplifted” (“enlightened”?) by the Benefactors.  Benefactors were involved in a big war at the time, and gave The Uplifted massive technology and training to earn their loyalty.  The Uplifted siezed on the new knowledge and their population boomed, inhabiting a dozen more worlds in decades.  Industrious, honorable, and fucking like rabbits, they developed a fierce loyalty to the Benefactors, fought with them, and led them to win their war.  Now, generations later, they are beginning to question their loyalty- Uplifted people are violently split as to whether they should uphold their fealty, or if the Benefactors are just oppurtunists, who were using them.

The uplifted value honor far above life.  Loyalists find great honor in serving the Benefactorsin any way.  The family is essential, and siring many offspring, and doing any work that supports their people.  (Their culture seems super utopian, except that it has lead them to such frequent war (though almost always with very external forces).) This conflict between good for their people and serving the Benefactors (who did something very good for them a long time ago) is the essence of their current political division.
The player can have great influence over the uplifted, and tip them to beginning a war with the Benefactors, into a massive internal civil war between loyalists and independent Uplifted, or onto some other paths-- some peaceful ones, maybe a second uplifting to another species (the unionists?, the archivists? the dramatics? the AI? the memoryless? the children? themselves -> nanopirates?).  

*Main quest: Help resolve the Uplifted’s identity crisis- accept the Benefactors, succeed from the Benefactors, or replace the Benefactors with another race to suck up to. (potentially conflicts with Benefactors)

==Non-Alliance==
===Nanopirates===
Nanotechnology is feared and regulated with redundant safeguards by treaties between most intelligent species.  The nanopirates are a group of individuals from a number of species who release uncontrolled mining nanites on mineral-rich asteroids, satellites, and sometimes entire planets, and later return to collect the most valuable of the now sorted and refined minerals.

They have a very anarchic society, and a somewhat outlaw culture.  Many other species attack them on sight or flee fearing nanite contamination (and indeed they favor nanite-based weapons).  Groups of nano pirates have on occasion launched mining nanites onto inhabited planets/asteroids (never ones that stood a chance against the nanites), forcing the inhabitants to flee or be converted into raw materials (mostly more nanites or carbon nanotubes).

*Main quest: help the nanopirates pillage the AI systems, steal AI technology, and claim AI space for their own. (conflicts with AI and Union)
===AI===
It’s a race entirely of computers.  Maybe their creators faced some catastrophe that they were unable to escape.  They do not know what happened to their creators and want to know.  Most are very outwardly friendly, but there are different factions, and will be more polite than kind.  They probably won’t attack first, but they will show off technology that makes the player want to attack them.  

*Main quest: become accepted by the AI, and earn some of their technology.  Maybe by helping them learn about who their creators were. (conflicts with Nanopirates)

===Dramatics===
This race values good drama above life.  In all their interactions, they try to introduce plot twists, revelations, character development.  They would rather die in a spectacular blaze of glory than not die in a spectacular blaze of glory today. Unless there might be an even more spectacular blaze tomorrow.  It is likely to encounter them exiled for some reason, lamenting said exile, on a quest to prove their love, or doing other dramatic stupid shit for no reason.  Their best technology reliably transcirbes their last minutes and sends it to their homeworld for distribution.  They are a great source for quests as they will sell all their worldly possessions to employ you on a silly quest to prove their dedication to something or another, but things are often not what they seem, although that is often foreshadowed in there verbose dialog.  

The Dramatics are occasionally members of the Alliance, but the frequently quit in dramatic fashion, claiming their honor has been insulted, or simply as a sudden plot twist.  When they are not members of the Alliance they speak against its unfairness, often claiming they were unfairly expelled.  They are at war with the Benefactors and the Memoryless for an especially valuable system, though their main motive is the terrific war stories.

*main quest: help the Dramatics win the war for c3. (conflicts with Benefactors and Memoryless)
Non-standard
===Memoryless===
A species that  retain tactile memory, so they can learn skills, but they don't have episodic memory, so they can't tell stories.
*Main quest: help the memoryless win the war for c3. (conflicts with Benefactors and Dramatics)
===Trees===
A race of trees.  Their ships are manned by seeds, which should seem more like stupid animals.  When pressed for anything important, the seeds will have to return to a planet to consult their creators.  This should seem like they are praying to their gods.  It should take some time/insight to realize that they are seeds and trees.  It should be fairly easy to communicate with the seeds, but difficult to communicate with the trees.

The trees send out seed ships to colonize other planets with more trees.  The trees have learned to intelligently grow the ships: mining some minerals with their roots, growing complex carbon materials, extracting gasses through their leaves, etc.  All of this takes a very long time, and tree expansion is very slow.  You are the only other species they know.  Careful examination will reveal that there are absolutely no other species on tree worlds larger than bacteria.  

Eventually it will come out that after the trees became intelligent (the first intelligence on their worlds), they began careful transformations of themselves and their world to eliminate all of the “pests”-- every other living organism, starting with the most tree-invasive animals, fungi, etc., and other trees that competed for resources, but eventually all animals.  Helpful animals were killed incidentally at first (as their food was killed off), but eventually came to also be hated by the trees.  The “purging” of their homeworld took thousands of years.  Now intelligent, the trees were able to take over the work of decomposers, etc. themselves, learning an astonishing amount of control over their biological processes, which has made them amazing terraformers.  Anything that doesn’t photosynthesis they consider a thief of their energy/hard work; anything else that photosynthesises they consider a competitor to be eliminated.

Once they fully understand what you are, they will attempt to learn your star maps (they are bad at exploring), and then destroy you.  If they learn from you that how many other alien species there are, they will freak out and begin designing real military crafts.  They will try to keep you from telling other species about them.

*Main quest: convince the trees that you are not a paracite that needs to be exterminated, and help the trees expand into g7 and h7 (h7 is a conflict with Child interests)
===Protos===
Protos are a race of simple, apparently single-celled organisms that are gigantic and can travel through space.  Communicating will be very difficult here, and they will rarely give any parts (but the ones they give will be super weird). They will try to eat your spaceship.  Kinda metroidy?  They favor warm, wet planets with very low gravity.

*Main quest: stop the human expansion into Proto space. (Conflicts with Humans)
===Humans===
You used to be one of these.  Humans were almost killed in the war with the xenosite zombie things.  That was before you drifted in space for a hundred years.  Now they are different.  The humans have claimed more systems than any other race (though less than the combined Alliance).  A lot of human colonies had to be destroyed or abandoned during their war with the Xenosites.  Now the Humans are expanding the other way- into Proto space, so they are increasingly fighting wars with the Protos, who aren’t really cohesive enough to mount organized resistance, but putting up a (defensive) fight anyways.  Humans have contact with the Alliance (primarily the Archivists), but do not seem too interested in joining it (although there are political factions who want to)- mostly they are too far away to become very integrated.  Humans seem to have a drive for expansion that is equaled only by the Benefactors (and the now deceased Xenosites).

*Main quest: help the humans expand into Proto space, conquering all the Protos.  Don’t worry, a few will be kept in a zoo. (conflicts with Protos)

===Children of the Stars===
A race that has always been taken by the beauty of the stars.  They raced to get into space, missing a lot of tech a lot of tech along the way.  Now they are widely spread out.  They have very little offensive tech, but have the best deflectors in the sector.  Their planets feature extremely powerful deflectors that make any potential enemies give up on attacking them.  They are especially interested in the birth and death of stars, planets, and life.  They are very curious, express everything in terms of beauty.  Might do ‘evil’ things just to see what happens, and they are unlikely to take it personally if you kill a few of their ships for deflectors. 

*Main quest: help the Children build a warp gate to h7, and to colonize h7.  (this conflicts with the tree quest).

===Xenosites===
The zombie race that you killed off, and became the last of.  I think there should be a way to spawn more somewhere from yourself (by infecting innocents), but then you fail to control them, and they try to kill you for being a rogue aberration.

The xenosite is a parasitic life form that is able to attach to an astonishing variety of hosts.  The limits of it’s adaptability are still not known, but potential hosts apparently include both humans and most electronic human technology.  The xenosite blurs the line between single celled and multi-cellular organisms, its cells able to exist individually for long periods, then multiply and specialize late in their life.  

As it develops, a xenosite exerts more and more control over its host, and exhibits more and more understanding of its environment.  Initially xenosite cells only steal energy and reproduce.  As they become acclimated to their host, they begin to specialize, developing various circulation systems and organs that make more efficient conversion of the food they are receiving from their host.  After achieving a certain size, neural centers develop which are able to interface with the host, much like a developing human brain learns to use its eyes and ears.  

In humans, there is a brief window when the host behavior is altered enough to be noticeable and the Xenosite is not aware enough to be dangerous.  The window typically lasts a few days, but the random mutative development of the Xenosite vary greatly.  In less than five per cent of cases, the xenosite kills its host, after which it will attempt to spread to new hosts in a diaspora like a fungal bloom.

* Main quest: restart the Xenosites and lead them to consume the galaxy. Or restart them, try to moderate their expansion, be labeled a renegade traitor by a new emerging central brain, and then fight and have to kill them again. (potentially conflicts with all)
